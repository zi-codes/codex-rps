# Codex Rock-Paper-Scissors

![Image screenshot](/screenshot.png)

Originally built for Makers (bootcamp) weekend challenge. This web app extends the basic mathematical principles behind any iteration of the 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game to build a customisable game with any number, n, of weapons, given that n is an odd number 3 or greater. Each weapon will have equal chance of winning.

Please note that this repository is part of the "Codex Z" series, which prioritises complexity and elegance of code over human readability. This is not to say that I consider these things mutually exclusive, but life is short and I have other fish to fry. To see the "Vanilla" version that follows "good practices", complete with RSpec testing framework, use `https://github.com/zi-codes/rps-challenge.git`
